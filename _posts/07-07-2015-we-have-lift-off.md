I've procured a server on which to host a demo instance of the platform. You can currently telnet to mud.panterasbox.com:2010, or try your luck with the web client at http://mud.panterasbox.com/~bobby/. This is the first time I'm really looking at this stuff since I stopped the major coding effort this past winter, there's a lot of holes to fill in before I can really show it off to anyone. Everything appears to be working that that should be working, though, so that's encouraging.
