Haven't coded anything for about a week. I started to code the pager but lost interest pretty quickly. It does need to get done though, having to use the editor to browse code is sub-optimal. This is the where I kinda wish I had an apprentice or an intern or something. It might be a bit much for someone who is brand new to programming, but it might not be. It's something that I don't really need personally, because I can more code externally out in zsh. It does, however, need to be done were I to throw up a demo instance anywhere. That makes it a good candidate for someone trying to learn, because they don't have to stress over too much over how quickly they're progressing. Meanwhile I'd be free to work on the more interesting stuff. Makes me think that maybe I should table this and instead put a little more effort into looking for candidates. The only reason I decided to work on it now was because I've got most of the rest of the shell done.

Speaking of which, I did quietly finish path expansion. I actually already wrote the algorithm years ago for EotL but I never implemented it anywhere. Revisiting it went pretty smoothly. It's actually pretty cool it supports wildcards in the middle of paths, so you can do like `ls /usr/*/workroom.c` to list all the workrooms. get_dir() resolves the actual wildcards for us, so the thing runs pretty fast. The one thing I would like to add is support for the ** wildcard, but the driver won't resolve that one for us so it's a bunch more work. It'd be nice to have for a future release, though.

I've actually started creating issues on github to track all this stuff, and I've been trying to use the special tags in my commit comments when I close out tasks and such. The more workflow we can capture, the more interesting game mechanics we'll be able to come up with later. What github offers in the way of issue tracking pales in comparison to Jira, which is what we use at WSI; but it's better to keep things simple for now anyway. I guess next I need to start thinking a little bit about recruitment, and pick something else to work on. I'm thinking object expansion, but I gotta get my head around what exactly it means to refer to an object on the command line, both in author mode and in player mode. It seems like you might want to apply different expansion algorithms depending on context, but how much of that is helpful and how much does it just clutter the UI? And does it even matter right now? Fun stuff.
