It looks like the next project is going to be containerization. The reason this is happening now is more about EotL than Acme, but since Acme is open source I'd rather do it here first and backport it over. In addition to setting up a CD pipeline and using containers to organize the game, there's also adding a git command to the mudlib and migrating EotL over to use it. There's obviously also environmental concerns with getting all this working on bfb, and getting the approval from the Janitors to actually do it, but there's so much I don't know yet that I'll wait on worrying about that until I get a handle on this stuff.

I haven't done much yet but install Jenkins and Docker, but I did go ahead and make a github project for this and create some issues. Project management? I know! Crazy! But I'm hoping to maybe collaborate on this with someone who has more devops experience than me and issue tracking is a good thing. Anyway, here's the link: https://github.com/orgs/acmemud/projects/1.
