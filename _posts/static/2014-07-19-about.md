The gabbo project has been through so many different revisions, I'm not sure it's appropriate to call it by that name anymore. Nonetheless, I've again restarted the project, this time focusing on writing the actual mudlib. The name 'gabbo mudlib foundation' doesn't mean we'll be giving grants to PBS or anything, the word foundation here refers to the 'foundation' layer of the platform as a whole. The platform we're talking about here is a MUD. If you don't know what that is, all you need to know right now is it's a game. 

This foundation layer sets the stage for that game to be played out, in the same way a pool table or a deck of cards are the foundation for which a game of billiards or poker will be played. By itself, the gabbo mudlib foundation has no goals, no challenges, and isn't much fun to play with. What you will be able to do is log in, move around, talk to people, make social connections, even create content if you feel so inclined.

Once the foundation is complete (or at least complete enough), then comes time to implement the actual game layer of the platform. There are a few variants I plan on implementing, but all my designs are very rough, until I get more user input. There are at least two games I want to build with this, one for my part-time employer, Williams-Sonoma, and one for End of the Line, an LP MUD that's been around since the late 80s.

The one for Williams-Sonoma can be more generally expressed as a productivity tool for software development. The MUD still be a place to move around and interact with people, but it will also be collecting all sorts of metrics about the software development process: code that's committed; bugs that are fixed; code reviews and the people contributing to them; comments that are left whether they're code comments, commit comments, or defect comments. Then you are rewarded in the game based on the data that's being collected.

What does being rewarded in the game get you? In terms of real-world rewards, that's a question left for my betters to say. But in the game, we can employ all sorts of common gaming devices; a few examples:

  * leaderboards - who's added/removed the most lines of code?
  * acheivements - get through UAT with no criticals, earn a badge
  * quests - for 1 week, extra points for every checkstyle issue found and fixed in a trunk branch, across the entire repo
  * groups - let the front-end developers on a project pool their rewards in the game
  * levels - break character advancement into tiers that get you access to game content not available to the lower levels

These are all different ways of tuning incentives in a software development organization, while also creating a feedback loop that helps management steer labor in the right direction. Right now, though, I'm just building the interfaces that will make coming up with those kinds of design elements possible. Once someone starts designing the actual game, there's implementation-specific code that will need to be written. As an example, I'm trying to gamify the development of gabbo itself by hooking into the different services that github provides. All of that code is specific to github and gabbo, and would need to be revisited if used for a different application.

That's a good enough description of the project for now. The other part of this project has to do with End of the Line, where I want to adapt the mudlib to run gabbo as a new distinct lib inside of the existing role-playing game. I'll also be extending the ability to create new content out to users, so everyone can experience the game either in "author mode" or "player mode". There will of course have to be constraints, but the new lib puts configuration and convention ahead of hard-coded LPC, so there will more stuff people will be able to do without actually writing any LPC code.

I'd like to keep the foundation code free and open-source, but folks are free to use whatever license they please for their individual implementations.
