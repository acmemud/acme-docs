# What's a MUD?

When I try to explain to people what gabbo is, this is where I usually start. To answer the question, there's a standard spiel I've been working on that kinda goes over the history, architecture, user experience, etc., so I thought this would be an easy post. I've been giving the question some more thought this past week though, and there's more to talk about here.

Wikipedia sorta boils it down to "a text-based multi-player computer role-playing game" which is how I think a lot of mudders would describe it. Personally, I think that misses the mark a little bit. Let's step back and think about what we can say about _all_ MUDs. 

Are they all text-based? Yes and no. MUD Connector has a section for "graphical MUDs," but the fact that they have to qualify them as such implies that the term "MUD" would otherwise mean text-based. Also, if you're talking about what you can do with just the raw telnet protocol that all the MUD drivers (that I know of), you're really limited to just text (though modern clients support different character sets which is cool).
