If I had to describe what gabbo is in one word, I would have to say that it's a model. Like a lot of models, it can have more than one intended use, so the real question is, why would you want to use it? Since the 'you' at this point is the reader, and I don't know anything about you, I'm going to try to break down the feature set into some different categories and hopefully there will be at least one that you can identify with.
